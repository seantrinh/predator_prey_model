# predator_prey_model

## Description
This project analyzes the population growth of two species via a predator-prey model through the use of MATLAB.

## Summary 
Predator prey is a popular model to explore the effect population have on one another. It is modeled through the use of ODEs. You can construct a differential equation for the rate of which preys grow according to the rate of predators and vice versa. Then using an approximation such as ode45, eulers, rk4, etc. you can figure out the actual population of each at a given time. The populations growth are periodic and can be described succinctly through a phase plot. 

## TODO 
- Create an euler function to approximate values
- Create rk4 function to approximate values
- Use ode45(built in), euler, and rk4 to model a predator prey relationship
