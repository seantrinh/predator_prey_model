# predator_prey_model

## Description
This project analyzes the population growth of two species via a predator-prey model through the use of MATLAB.

## Summary 
Predator prey is a popular model to explore the effect population have on one another. It is modeled through the use of ODEs. You can construct a differential equation for the rate of which preys grow according to the rate of predators and vice versa. Then using an approximation such as ode45, eulers, rk4, etc. you can figure out the actual population of each at a given time. The populations growth are periodic and can be described succinctly through a phase plot. 


## TODO 
- Use ode45(built in) and rk45 to model a predator prey relationship
- Create an interactive graph

## Done 
- rk4
- rk45
- euler
- modified euler
- Model using Euler
- Model using Modified Euler
- Model using rk4
